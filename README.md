### Hello there 👋

My name is Matthew Dettman, and I wake up every day eager to open up RStudio and make something happen 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

I have worked in Excel for many years but was introduced to Python for Algorithmic Trading in 2019, and it was a game changer.  I am not sure why I never considered learning computer programming before then.  For years I was hooked on technical analysis and analyzing stock charts, so It connected with me in learning to replicate the charting platforms I used.   

* 🤵 Currently not working and working toward finding a role that I love.  
* 💻 I have over 10 years of experience in the financial services industry.  My last few roles were focused on managing financial advisors, many of whom I miss, but I must move toward achieving new goals I have set for myself.  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my R portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about R. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on R.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with obtaining a job right now.  
- 💬 Ask me about financial planning, investments, or R codes.
