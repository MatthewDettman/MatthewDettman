### Hello there 👋


My name is Matthew Dettman, and I wake up every day eager to open up RStudio and make something happen 🚀.

I have over 10 years of experience in the financial services industry.  My last few roles focused on managing financial advisors and ensuring they don’t break SEC or FINRA rules.  

I worked in Excel for many years but was introduced to Python for Algorithmic Trading in 2019, and it was a game changer.  I am not sure why I never considered learning computer programming before then.  For years I was hooked on technical analysis and analyzing stock charts, so It connected with me in learning to replicate the charting platforms I used.     📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
